# CodeGraph MCP Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed (Phase 1 - Core Tools)

### MCP Tools - Real Implementation Done
1. **analyze_codebase** - Now queries actual database for:
   - Real file/function/class counts
   - Language distribution from metadata
   - Most connected components
   - Complex files analysis
   - Actual capability status

2. **find_implementation** - Now performs real searches:
   - Searches by name and content in database
   - Finds functions, classes, methods
   - Returns actual file locations and line numbers
   - Shows content previews

3. **trace_execution** - Now traces real execution paths:
   - Finds entry points in database
   - Follows relationship chains (CALLS, IMPORTS, etc.)
   - Shows actual execution paths
   - Tracks visited nodes

4. **impact_analysis** - Now analyzes real impact:
   - Finds components in database
   - Queries direct dependents
   - Queries indirect impact (2 levels)
   - Calculates real risk scores
   - Provides actual recommendations

5. **explain_architecture** - Now analyzes real structure:
   - Queries actual file statistics
   - Detects real modules from file paths
   - Shows actual relationship counts
   - Identifies architectural centers

## ‚ùå Still To Do

### Phase 2 - Resources (High Priority)
1. **architecture resource** - Currently returns fake modules ("Core", "API", "Utils")
2. **dependencies resource** - Returns hardcoded packages (express, react)
3. **hotspots resource** - Returns fake file changes
4. **status resource** - Always returns indexed: false
5. **metrics resource** - Returns hardcoded metrics (150 files, 25000 LOC)

### Phase 3 - Progressive Enhancement
1. Connect progressive-tools.ts to actually use the real implementations
2. Make responses adapt based on indexing progress
3. Implement actual search strategy changes

### Phase 4 - Parser Enhancement
1. Fix parser to extract imports/exports
2. Extract function calls
3. Track variable references
4. Parse type definitions

### Phase 5 - Testing & Documentation
1. Create integration tests for new implementations
2. Update README.md with accurate status
3. Add comprehensive TO-DO LIST section
4. Document API changes

## üîß Technical Debt Identified

1. **Database Access Pattern**: Each tool opens its own database connection - should use shared connection
2. **Error Handling**: Need better error messages when database doesn't exist
3. **Performance**: No caching of frequently accessed data
4. **Type Safety**: Heavy use of `any` types in database queries
5. **Code Duplication**: Database path calculation repeated in every function

## üìä Progress Summary

- **MCP Tools**: 5/8 implemented (62.5%)
- **MCP Resources**: 0/5 implemented (0%)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: 0% complete
- **Parser Enhancement**: 0% complete
- **Testing**: Basic tests only
- **Documentation**: Needs major update

## üéØ Next Priority Actions

1. Implement the 5 MCP resources to query real data
2. Fix the remaining 3 MCP tools (get_indexing_status, get_capabilities, wait_for_indexing)
3. Connect progressive enhancement
4. Create integration tests
5. Update README with reality

## üí° Key Insights

The codebase has good infrastructure but was released with stub implementations. The core components (parser, graph, embeddings) work, but weren't connected to the MCP interface. This is a classic case of "proof of concept" code being presented as complete.

The actual implementation requires:
- Proper database queries instead of hardcoded responses
- Real data aggregation from the graph
- Actual relationship traversal
- True progressive enhancement based on capabilities

## üöÄ Estimated Completion

With the current progress:
- Phase 2 (Resources): 1-2 days
- Phase 3 (Progressive): 1 day
- Phase 4 (Parser): 1-2 days
- Phase 5 (Testing/Docs): 2 days

**Total: 5-7 more days to reach full functionality**
